            <h3>Another 24 hours of twists and turn in the title race</h3>
            <p>In a season of many surprises, the weekend of Matchweek 24 did not disappoint as the title race took
                further twists and turns over a period of just over 24 hours. 

                Arsenal started the day looking to return to top spot having been knocked off their perch with a 3-1
                home loss to Manchester City in midweek.

                The Gunners' early kick-off at Aston Villa on Saturday handed them the perfect opportunity to
                leapfrog Man City and return to pole position.

                By 14:15 GMT, however, things were looking bleak for Mikel Arteta's side

                Less than three days after that heartbreaking home defeat by City, which led to Arsenal
                relinquishing their position as league leaders for the first time since 5 November, they looked set
                to go further behind the champions.

                At half-time at Aston Villa, they trailed 2-1. They needed a win but the last time they had trailed
                at half-time in a match outside London and gone on to claim three points was way back in 2009 at
                Anfield.</p>

            <h3>Rashford and Salah given Double Gameweek 29</h3>
            <p>Marcus Rashford (£7.3m) and Mohamed Salah (£12.6m) are both set for a Double Gameweek 29 in Fantasy
                Premier League following the rescheduling of six matches earlier today.

                Twelve sides, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea, have been handed a bumper Double
                Gameweek 29.

                AFC Bournemouth’s home tie with Brighton & Hove Albion, along with Leeds United versus Nottingham
                Forest, Leicester City against Aston Villa and Chelsea's encounter with Liverpool have all been
                moved to Tuesday 4 April.

                Meanwhile, Man Utd’s match with Brentford, and West Ham United versus Newcastle United, will take
                place the following day.</p>

            <h3>April 2023 broadcast picks and fixture changes announced</h3>
            <p>The Premier League has announced the broadcast selections for April in the UK, some of which are
                subject to movement dependent on the clubs’ participation in UEFA competitions.

                This also includes the rescheduling of six of the seven current postponed matches and confirms that
                all fixtures on the final day of the 2022/23 season will kick off at 16:30 BST on Sunday 28 May to
                avoid a clash with an EFL play-off final.

                Kick-offs 15:00 unless stated. All times BST.</p>
